NOSQL resources

Application Name: Movie Picker

Project Description:
Helps you search for a movie based on the criteria that you select. This application allows users to search, insert, update, and delete movie information from the database. Users can also search which movies were popular by the year.
You can also add ratings for movies, get tag information and find movies by tags, among many other features. Since the dataset is “movies”, application will benefit from NoSQL deployment in terms of horizontal scalability. As new movies are released, we can add them to our database without worrying about storage. It makes data analysis and queries much easier, especially in a distributed environment with large data sizes.

Connected to the database with PyMongo and issued queries from there.
Built 15 functionalities and allowed users to access them through console commands.
